# Code Coverage: Key Takeaways

1. **Statement Coverage**  
   Checks if every line of code has been executed. Useful to make sure all code runs but doesn't cover all possible paths.

2. **Branch Coverage**  
   Ensures that all possible outcomes (like "yes" and "no" in conditions) are tested. Better at showing how the logic works.

3. **Predicate Coverage**  
   Tests all combinations of conditions. Very detailed, but can require many tests if there are lots of conditions.
